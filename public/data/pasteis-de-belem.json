    "short": "Since 1837, Pastéis de Belém has been crafting the original Portuguese custard tarts following a secret recipe from the nearby Jerónimos Monastery. This legendary bakery serves thousands of the warm, crispy pastéis daily to locals and tourists alike.",
    "full": "Pastéis de Belém is a Portuguese institution and pilgrimage site for food lovers worldwide. Established in 1837, this historic confectionery began making custard tarts using an ancient secret recipe from the monks of the nearby Mosteiro dos Jerónimos. That same secret recipe - known only to a select few master bakers who work behind closed doors - is still used today to create the authentic Pastéis de Belém. The bakery produces over 20,000 tarts daily during peak season, all made by hand using traditional methods. The crispy, flaky puff pastry shells are filled with creamy egg custard and baked to perfection, creating a caramelized top that locals dust with cinnamon and powdered sugar. The sprawling building features multiple ornately-tiled dining rooms that can seat over 400 people, plus a take-away section and gift shop. Whether you queue for a table in the historic blue-and-white azulejo-tiled rooms or grab tarts to go, visiting Pastéis de Belém is an essential Lisbon experience. The atmosphere blends old-world charm with efficient service, as white-coated waiters navigate the busy rooms carrying trays of fresh pastéis alongside Portuguese coffee. Beyond the famous tarts, the bakery offers other traditional Portuguese sweets, savory snacks, and full meals. The location in Belém makes it perfect for combining with visits to nearby monuments like Jerónimos Monastery and Belém Tower.",
    "history": "In 1837, following the liberal revolution of 1820 and the closure of Portugal's monasteries, someone connected to the Mosteiro dos Jerónimos began selling pastéis de nata from a nearby sugar refinery. The bakery opened at its current location in Belém and obtained the secret recipe from the monastery. For nearly 200 years, the Clarinha family and their descendants have jealously guarded this recipe, making Pastéis de Belém the only place in the world where you can taste the original monastery version. The bakery has remained in continuous operation at the same location since 1837.",
    "significance": "Pastéis de Belém holds legendary status in Portuguese culture as the birthplace and sole guardian of the original monastery custard tart recipe. While pastéis de nata are sold throughout Portugal and the world, only here can they legally be called 'Pastéis de Belém.' The bakery is a living monument to Portuguese culinary tradition and has been recognized as one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Gastronomy. It attracts millions of visitors annually and represents Portuguese sweet-making heritage."
