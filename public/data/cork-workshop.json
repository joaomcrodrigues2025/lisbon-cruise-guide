    "short": "Immerse yourself in Portugal's cork industry heritage through an interactive workshop where you'll learn about sustainable cork harvesting and create your own unique cork crafts, from coasters to jewelry.",
    "full": "Portugal produces over half the world's cork supply, and this unique workshop experience offers cruise passengers a hands-on introduction to one of the country's most sustainable and iconic industries. Led by local artisans and designers, the Cork Workshop Experience takes you on a journey through cork's rich history in Portuguese culture, from ancient wine stoppers to modern fashion accessories. Learn about the fascinating cork oak forests of Alentejo and the environmentally-friendly harvesting process that allows trees to produce cork for over 200 years without being damaged. The workshop provides all materials and tools as you design and create your own cork products, typically including coasters decorated with Mediterranean patterns and jewelry pieces that blend traditional techniques with modern aesthetics. Portugal's cork industry isn't just about wine bottles; this versatile material is used in aerospace insulation, luxury handbags, footwear, and sustainable home decor. Through painting, cutting, and assembling techniques, you'll discover why cork's unique properties make it so valuable. The intimate workshop setting allows for personalized instruction and creative freedom, making it suitable for all skill levels from complete beginners to craft enthusiasts.",
    "history": "Cork has been harvested in Portugal since ancient times, with the Montado cork oak forests of Alentejo representing one of the world's most sustainable agricultural systems. The traditional cork industry expanded dramatically in the 17th and 18th centuries with the growth of wine production. Today, Portugal's cork forests absorb millions of tons of CO2 annually, making cork one of the most eco-friendly materials available.",
    "significance": "Portugal is the world's largest cork producer, responsible for over 50% of global cork production. The industry supports thousands of families and protects vital Mediterranean ecosystems. Cork workshops help preserve traditional craftsmanship while educating visitors about sustainable materials and Portuguese heritage."
