    "short": "By The Wine brings the complete range of Sogrape wines - Portugal's largest wine producer - to a relaxed, cosmopolitan wine bar in Chiado. Since 2015, it has been the perfect spot to discover Portuguese wines alongside carefully curated tapas and regional specialties.",
    "full": "By The Wine opened in the heart of Chiado in 2015 as a flagship wine bar showcasing the extensive portfolio of Sogrape, Portugal's largest and most prestigious wine producer. Since March 2021, the bar exclusively presents the entire range of Sogrape wines, including iconic brands such as Mateus Rosé, Casa Ferreirinha (Douro), Herdade do Peso (Alentejo), Quinta dos Carvalhais (Dão), Quinta da Romeira (Lisboa), and the famous Port wines from Sandeman and Ferreira. The selection extends to Sogrape's international properties in New Zealand, Argentina, Chile, and Spain, offering around 80 wine references in total. The relaxed and cosmopolitan space pairs these exceptional wines with a diverse gastronomic menu featuring homemade Algarvian bread, Iberian bellota ham platters, salmon ceviche, loin steak sandwiches (bifanas), beef carpaccio, veal cheek, and an array of Portuguese and Spanish tapas. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, perfect for an informal snack between sightseeing or a full dining experience. The knowledgeable staff guide guests through wine selections, making it ideal for both wine connoisseurs and curious beginners. Whether stopping for a quick glass and petiscos (Portuguese tapas) or settling in for a multi-course meal, By The Wine offers an authentic taste of Portugal's rich wine culture. In November 2024, a second location opened in Porto, expanding this successful concept. The Chiado location's central position makes it a convenient stop during city exploration, and the vibrant atmosphere attracts a mix of locals and tourists throughout the day and evening.",
    "history": "By The Wine opened in Chiado in 2015 as an innovative wine bar concept, initially showcasing various Portuguese wines. In March 2021, it became exclusively dedicated to Sogrape wines, becoming the winery's flagship tasting venue in Lisbon. Sogrape, founded by Fernando van Zeller Guedes, has been producing Portuguese wines since the early 20th century and is known worldwide for Mateus Rosé. The partnership created a unique space where Sogrape's full range - from everyday table wines to premium reserves and vintage Ports - could be experienced in a casual setting.",
    "significance": "By The Wine serves as an ambassador for Portuguese wine culture in one of Lisbon's most visited neighborhoods. It democratizes wine tasting by offering high-quality wines by the glass in a relaxed atmosphere, making premium Portuguese wines accessible to all. The bar plays an educational role in promoting Portuguese wine regions and varieties to international visitors while maintaining popularity with discerning locals."
