    "short": "Parque das Nações is Lisbon's ultra-modern waterfront district, born from Expo 98. This family-friendly area features wide pedestrian promenades, contemporary architecture, waterfront gardens, the Oceanarium, science museum, cable car, and excellent dining options.",
    "full": "Parque das Nações represents Lisbon's vision of the future - a striking waterfront district that rose from abandoned industrial land to become one of Europe's most successful urban renewal projects. Built to host Expo 98 (celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's voyage to India), this contemporary neighborhood has evolved into a thriving, family-oriented community. The district stretches along the Tejo estuary with wide, traffic-free promenades, innovative water gardens, and bold modern architecture. Unlike historic Lisbon with its narrow cobblestone streets and hills, Parque das Nações offers flat, spacious walkways perfect for strollers and wheelchairs. The area is anchored by major attractions including the Oceanário de Lisboa (Europe's largest aquarium), Pavilhão do Conhecimento (interactive science museum), and the Telecabine cable car offering panoramic views. Families appreciate the free water features like Jardins da Água with fountains and waterfalls, exploding water volcano towers, and the Jardim da Música with interactive play areas. The district showcases Vasco da Gama-themed architecture including the Torre Vasco da Gama (Lisbon's tallest building), apartment towers designed like sailing ships, and the Vasco da Gama Bridge. The Centro Vasco da Gama shopping center provides dining, cinema, and retail. The area features over 120 restaurants ranging from traditional Portuguese to international cuisine, plus trendy bars and the Casino de Lisboa. The waterfront marina offers a peaceful setting for evening strolls. With its combination of attractions, green spaces, dining, and modern infrastructure, Parque das Nações provides a complete family day out and showcases Lisbon's contemporary identity.",
    "history": "Parque das Nações was created for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 'Oceans: A Heritage for the Future' theme. The site was previously Lisbon's industrial zone and petroleum storage area - a desolate wasteland along the Tejo River. The Portuguese government invested heavily in transforming this 5-kilometer stretch into a modern exhibition space. After Expo 98 ended successfully with millions of visitors, planners wisely converted the area into a permanent residential and commercial district rather than letting it decay. The thoughtful post-Expo development created a sustainable neighborhood combining residential towers, office spaces, cultural venues, parks, and infrastructure. Today it stands as a model of successful urban regeneration.",
    "significance": "Parque das Nações represents Lisbon's modern face and successful urban renewal. The district demonstrates how industrial wasteland can be transformed into vibrant, sustainable communities. It serves as a major residential area for 25,000 people, an important business center, and Lisbon's premier family entertainment zone. The area symbolizes Portugal's forward-looking identity while honoring its maritime heritage. It's become a case study in post-event urban planning worldwide."
