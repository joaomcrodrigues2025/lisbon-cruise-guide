  "description": {
    "short": "A stunning 18th-century Rococo palace often called the 'Portuguese Versailles,' featuring opulent royal rooms, French-inspired baroque gardens, and beautiful azulejo-tiled halls that served as a summer residence for Portuguese royalty.",
    "full": "The National Palace of Queluz is one of the most remarkable examples of Rococo architecture in Portugal and often compared to Versailles for its grandeur and beauty. Built in the 18th century as a summer residence for Dom Pedro de Bragança, who later became King Pedro III, the palace showcases the opulence of Portuguese royalty during its golden age. The palace's magnificent interior features elaborately decorated rooms with painted ceilings, gilded woodwork, crystal chandeliers, and stunning azulejo tile panels depicting mythological and courtly scenes. The Music Room and Throne Room are particularly spectacular, showcasing the finest Portuguese and European craftsmanship. The formal gardens are equally impressive, designed in the French baroque style with geometric hedges, ornamental fountains, statuary, and the famous Azulejo Canal - a waterway lined with blue and white tiles depicting nautical scenes. The gardens include both the Hanging Garden and Neptune Garden, offering peaceful spots to admire the palace architecture and meticulously manicured landscaping. The palace witnessed significant royal events and served as the birthplace of Queen Maria I and the residence of the Portuguese Royal Family until 1807. Today it hosts classical music concerts in its beautiful halls, bringing the palace back to life with the sounds it was designed to showcase.",
    "history": "Construction of Queluz Palace began in 1747 under the direction of Portuguese architect Mateus Vicente de Oliveira and was later expanded by French architect Jean-Baptiste Robillion. Initially conceived as a summer pavilion, it evolved into one of Portugal's grandest royal palaces. King Pedro III and Queen Maria I made it their principal residence, and it became a center of court life and entertainment. The palace was damaged by fire in 1934 but carefully restored to its former glory. The palace garden layouts were inspired by Le Nôtre's work at Versailles, bringing French formal garden design to Portugal.",
    "significance": "Queluz Palace represents the height of Portuguese Rococo architecture and is one of the last great Rococo buildings constructed in Europe. It's a UNESCO-recognized monument and one of the finest palace ensembles in Portugal, offering insight into royal court life of the 18th century. The palace is still used occasionally for official government ceremonies and state visits."
