    "short": "Experience Portugal's most famous export with guided port wine tastings in Lisbon. Learn about the history, production, and varieties of port wine while sampling premium selections paired with Portuguese cheeses and charcuterie.",
    "full": "Port wine tasting in Lisbon offers cruise passengers an authentic introduction to Portugal's most celebrated fortified wine. While port is produced in the Douro Valley, Lisbon hosts excellent tasting venues where expert sommeliers guide you through the different styles - from crisp white ports to rich tawny and vintage varieties. These experiences typically include 3-5 premium port tastings, accompanied by artisanal Portuguese cheeses, cured meats, and traditional pasteis de nata. You'll learn about the unique production process, including the addition of brandy that stops fermentation and creates port's signature sweetness and higher alcohol content. Sommeliers explain the differences between ruby, tawny, white, and rosé ports, the significance of aging, and proper serving temperatures. Many tastings take place in atmospheric wine bars in historic Lisbon neighborhoods like Alfama or Baixa, combining the wine education with cultural immersion. The experience often includes stories about port's 2000-year history in Portugal and its special relationship with England, which helped make port world-famous. Whether you're a wine connoisseur or curious beginner, port wine tastings offer an accessible, delicious way to understand Portuguese wine culture. Some experiences also include visits to historic port wine cellars and opportunities to purchase bottles to take home.",
    "history": "Port wine has been produced in Portugal for over 2000 years, with the Douro Valley officially demarcated in 1756 - making it the world's oldest regulated wine region. The fortification process was developed in the 17th century to preserve wine during long sea voyages to England. The strong trade relationship between Portugal and Britain made port hugely popular in the English market, earning it the nickname 'the Englishman's wine.'",
    "significance": "Port wine is Portugal's most famous wine export and a UNESCO-recognized product. It represents centuries of Portuguese winemaking tradition and remains an essential part of the country's cultural and economic identity. Tasting port in Portugal offers authenticity and direct connection to this storied tradition."
