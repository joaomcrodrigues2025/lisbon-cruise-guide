    "short": "The Elevador da Bica is Lisbon's most photographed funicular, climbing the steep Rua da Bica de Duarte Belo with dramatic views of the Tagus River. Dating from 1892, this charming yellow tram connects Cais do Sodre with Bairro Alto through the picturesque Bairro da Bica neighborhood.",
    "full": "The Elevador da Bica is arguably Lisbon's most iconic and photogenic funicular, immortalized in countless photos and social media posts. Inaugurated on June 28, 1892, this delightful funicular railway connects the Cais do Sodre waterfront area (Rua de Sao Paulo) with the hilltop Bairro Alto district (Rua do Loreto) via a steep 283-meter route with an average gradient of 11 percent. The two charming yellow carriages travel the entire length of Rua da Bica de Duarte Belo through the authentic Bairro da Bica neighborhood, offering glimpses into traditional Lisbon life with colorful houses, hanging laundry, and neighborhood cafes. What makes Bica truly special is its dramatic setting: the steep street leads the eye down toward the sparkling Tagus River, creating one of Lisbon's most photographed vistas. Originally powered by water (with tanks on the carriage roofs), then steam in 1896, the funicular was electrified in 1924 using the same carriages that operate today. The system works with two cars connected by a cable - as one ascends, it assists the other's descent. Classified as a National Monument in 2002, the funicular is operated by Carris as route 53E. The neighborhood surrounding it has become a vibrant part of Lisbon's nightlife and creative scene, with street art adorning many walls, though this sometimes includes graffiti on the funicular itself.",
    "history": "The Elevador da Bica was the third funicular installed in Lisbon. It opened June 28, 1892, using an innovative water-powered system where reservoirs on carriage roofs were filled/emptied to control movement. Converted to steam power in 1896, then electrified in 1924 with the current carriages. The funicular was designed by Portuguese engineer Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard, who studied under Gustave Eiffel. It has been operating continuously for over 130 years, making it an essential part of Lisbon's transport history.",
    "significance": "A National Monument since 2002 and Lisbon's most photographed funicular. The dramatic street view with the Tagus River backdrop has become an iconic image of Lisbon, representing the city's steep topography, historic charm, and successful preservation of heritage transport."
