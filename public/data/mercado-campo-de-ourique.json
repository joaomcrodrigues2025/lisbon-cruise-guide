    "short": "Mercado de Campo de Ourique is a charming blend of traditional Portuguese market and modern food court, offering fresh produce, artisanal products, and diverse cuisine in a relaxed neighborhood atmosphere beloved by locals.",
    "full": "Mercado de Campo de Ourique represents a successful marriage of tradition and modernity in Lisbon's food scene. This neighborhood market combines classic market stalls selling fresh fish, meat, fruits, vegetables, and Portuguese specialties with a contemporary food court featuring diverse culinary options from traditional Portuguese to international cuisines. Unlike the touristy Time Out Market, Campo de Ourique maintains an authentic local vibe, attracting neighborhood residents for daily shopping and casual dining. The market's layout creates a beautiful symbiosis: food court vendors source ingredients directly from the market stalls, ensuring freshness while supporting traditional vendors. Communal seating fills the center of the market, surrounded by both food stalls and produce vendors, creating a lively social atmosphere. The food court section offers everything from traditional Portuguese petiscos and seafood to Asian cuisine, gourmet burgers, fresh juices, craft beer, and artisanal coffee. You might find bacalhau croquettes next to Vietnamese pho, Portuguese wine bars beside craft beer taps, and traditional pastries alongside modern fusion dishes. The market building itself features attractive architecture and good natural lighting, making it an pleasant space to linger. Morning visits reveal the traditional market in full swing, with locals selecting fresh ingredients, while lunch and evening transform it into a buzzing dining destination. Located in the residential Campo de Ourique neighborhood away from main tourist zones, the market offers an authentic glimpse into local Lisbon life while providing excellent food at reasonable prices.",
    "history": "Mercado de Campo de Ourique, like many Lisbon neighborhood markets, was originally built in the early 20th century to serve the local community with fresh produce and goods. As shopping habits changed and supermarkets emerged, many traditional markets struggled or closed. Campo de Ourique's market underwent renovation and reinvention, adding the food court concept while preserving the traditional market section. This hybrid model proved successful, revitalizing the space and making it financially viable while maintaining its community role.",
    "significance": "Mercado de Campo de Ourique demonstrates how traditional markets can evolve and survive by adapting to contemporary needs while preserving their essential character. It serves as a neighborhood anchor, providing both daily necessities and social gathering space. Unlike purely tourist-oriented food halls, it remains genuinely local while welcoming visitors, offering an authentic window into Lisbon's everyday life and food culture."
