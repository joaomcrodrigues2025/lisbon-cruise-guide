    "short": "An innovative interactive center located inside Pillar 7 of the iconic Ponte 25 de Abril, offering a unique journey through the bridge's history, multimedia exhibits, virtual reality experiences, and a stunning panoramic viewing platform.",
    "full": "The Pilar 7 Bridge Experience is a cutting-edge cultural attraction that transforms one of the seven massive pillars supporting Lisbon's iconic Ponte 25 de Abril into an immersive journey of discovery. Located in the Alcântara district along the Avenida da Índia waterfront, this interactive center invites visitors to explore both the exterior and interior of this key structural pillar of one of the world's most beautiful suspension bridges. The experience begins with a fascinating tour through the history of the bridge's construction, utilizing state-of-the-art multimedia devices that bring the engineering marvel to life. Visitors explore the exterior areas surrounding the pillar before venturing inside for a truly unique sensory experience. The journey culminates with an exhilarating elevator ride ascending to a panoramic viewing platform positioned at bridge level, providing unrivalled views of Lisbon, the Tagus River, and the surrounding landscape from a perspective few ever get to see. The observation deck offers breathtaking vistas that stretch across the city's hills, out to the Atlantic, and along the river's expanse. Following the viewing platform visit, guests participate in an immersive virtual reality experience that transports them to parts of the bridge that are normally inaccessible to the public, including the top of the towers and the main cable walkways high above the river. The VR technology provides a thrilling sense of what it's like to be a bridge worker performing maintenance hundreds of meters above the water. The visit concludes with a stop at the PhotoBooth, where visitors can capture and memorialize their unforgettable experience. Throughout the center, interactive displays explain the bridge's engineering, its historical significance in connecting Lisbon to the south bank, and its cultural impact on the city and country. The Ponte 25 de Abril, often compared to San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge due to their similar appearance and engineering, opened in 1966 and remains one of the longest suspension bridges in Europe.",
    "history": "The Ponte 25 de Abril was inaugurated on August 6, 1966, as the Salazar Bridge, named after Portugal's dictator. Following the Carnation Revolution of April 25, 1974, which brought democracy to Portugal, the bridge was renamed '25 de Abril Bridge' to commemorate that historic date. The Pilar 7 Bridge Experience opened as a cultural attraction in 2017, transforming the seventh pillar into an interactive museum and observation point, allowing the public to engage with this engineering icon for the first time.",
    "significance": "The experience offers unprecedented public access to one of Portugal's most iconic modern structures. The Ponte 25 de Abril is a symbol of Lisbon and represents both the country's engineering prowess and its democratic transformation. The Pilar 7 experience democratizes access to this monument, allowing visitors to understand and appreciate the bridge's construction, history, and ongoing importance to the city."
