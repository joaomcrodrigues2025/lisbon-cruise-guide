  "description": {
    "short": "Igreja de São Roque is a 16th-century Jesuit church in Lisbon's Bairro Alto district, famous for its ornate baroque interior despite having one of the city's simplest facades. The church houses the Chapel of St. John the Baptist, one of the world's most expensive chapels ever built.",
    "full": "The Church of São Roque stands as a testament to the deceptive nature of architectural appearances. While its facade is among Lisbon's plainest following the 1755 earthquake, the interior represents Portuguese Baroque artistry at its zenith. Built in 1565 by the Society of Jesus, it was Portugal's first Jesuit church and served as the order's headquarters until their expulsion in 1759. The church's pièce de résistance is the Chapel of St. John the Baptist, commissioned by King João V in 1742 and constructed in Rome using the finest materials available—lapis lazuli, agate, alabaster, porphyry, Carrara marble, and gold. The chapel was blessed by Pope Benedict XIV at Sant'Andrea delle Fratte in Rome before being disassembled, shipped to Lisbon in three ships, and meticulously reconstructed. Eight additional chapels line the nave, each dedicated to different saints and displaying various artistic styles from Mannerist to Baroque. The church's painted wooden ceiling creates the illusion of vaulted stone through trompe-l'oeil techniques. Adjacent to the church, the São Roque Museum houses sacred art, vestments, and treasures from the Jesuit period, including pieces from the chapel's original Roman construction. The church miraculously survived the 1755 earthquake largely intact, preserving its artistic treasures for future generations.",
    "history": "Founded in 1565 by the Jesuits, Igreja de São Roque was designed by architect Afonso Álvares and Filippo Terzi. The church was built on the site of a plague cemetery and chapel dedicated to São Roque, patron saint of plague victims. Following the expulsion of the Jesuits from Portugal in 1759, the church was donated to Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa, a charitable institution that maintains it today. The church underwent restoration in the 20th century to preserve its artistic heritage.",
    "significance": "The chapel of St. John the Baptist is considered one of the most expensive chapels ever constructed and represents the pinnacle of 18th-century decorative arts. The church demonstrates Portugal's wealth and power during the Age of Discovery and houses one of Europe's finest collections of sacred art. It remains an active place of worship while serving as an important cultural monument."
