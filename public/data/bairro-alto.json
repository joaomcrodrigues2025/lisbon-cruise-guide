    "short": "Bairro Alto is Lisbon's legendary nightlife district, a maze of narrow cobblestone streets that transforms from quiet residential area by day into one of Europe's most concentrated party hubs by night.",
    "full": "Bairro Alto, meaning 'upper district', extends over the hill to the west of central Lisbon and the Baixa district. At the heart of Bairro Alto are narrow cobbled streets densely packed with apartments, restaurants and bars. This historic neighborhood has always been associated with liberals and progressives, and after the collapse of the authoritarian dictatorship of the Estado Novo in 1974, the area became a haven for those simply wanting to enjoy life. Found within a relatively compact area are over two hundred family-run restaurants and small bars, catering for every genre and taste. Many of these bars are tiny, only providing seating for a handful of patrons, so as the night progresses the socializing spills out onto the streets, and the entire district becomes one huge party. The unique grid layout of central Bairro Alto is unusual for a medieval-era city district, as it originally followed ancient farming plots which were rectangular in size. Bairro Alto has matured since the heady days of the 1980s, but it is still the location for vibrant nightlife and late-night socializing, attracting both locals and tourists who come to experience authentic Lisbon nightlife.",
    "history": "Bairro Alto was developed in the 16th century as a planned neighborhood, unusual for its time with its grid-pattern streets. Throughout its history, it has been home to intellectuals, artists, and bohemians. The area survived the devastating 1755 earthquake relatively intact. In 1988, the neighboring Chiado was ravaged by a terrible fire, but Bairro Alto escaped damage. After Portugal's 1974 revolution ending the Estado Novo dictatorship, Bairro Alto flourished as a center of freedom and expression.",
    "significance": "Bairro Alto represents the bohemian soul of Lisbon and is one of the city's most important cultural and nightlife districts. It's a living example of how historic neighborhoods can maintain their character while serving modern purposes. The district is famous for its authentic atmosphere where locals and visitors mix freely, creating a unique social experience."
