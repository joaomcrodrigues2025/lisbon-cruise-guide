    "short": "Praça do Comércio, also known as Terreiro do Paço, is Lisbon's grandest and most iconic square. This vast yellow-colonnaded plaza opens directly onto the Tagus River and served as the entrance to the city for centuries. It's just 10 minutes walk from the cruise terminals.",
    "full": "Praça do Comércio stands as one of Europe's most beautiful and impressive public squares, a magnificent yellow-colonnaded plaza that opens majestically onto the Tagus River. Measuring 175 meters by 175 meters, this vast square was designed as Lisbon's grand ceremonial entrance - the 'Gateway to Lisbon' where visiting dignitaries, explorers, and traders first set foot after disembarking from ships. The square is framed on three sides by elegant 18th-century Pombaline buildings painted in distinctive bright yellow with arcaded ground floors housing cafes, restaurants, and government offices. The southern side opens entirely to the river via a broad marble staircase known as Cais das Colunas (Pier of Columns), flanked by two monumental columns that once marked the royal landing point. At the center of the square stands an imposing equestrian statue of King José I, whose prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal, masterminded Lisbon's reconstruction after the devastating 1755 earthquake. The northern end of the square is dominated by the magnificent Arco da Rua Augusta, a triumphal arch adorned with allegorical statues representing Glory, Genius, and Valor, crowned by a dramatic sculptural group. Visitors can climb inside the arch for spectacular rooftop views. The square is historically known as Terreiro do Paço (Palace Square) because the royal Ribeira Palace stood here for nearly 250 years until the 1755 earthquake and tsunami completely destroyed it. The Marquis of Pombal seized the opportunity to redesign the waterfront, creating this grand neoclassical square as part of his ambitious Baixa rebuilding project. Today, Praça do Comércio serves as Lisbon's living room - a place where locals and tourists gather, events and concerts take place, and the essence of Lisbon's relationship with the sea is palpable. The square witnessed some of Portugal's most dramatic historical moments, including the assassination of King Carlos I and Crown Prince Luís Filipe in 1908, which helped precipitate the end of the monarchy. For cruise passengers, this square is especially significant as it's the closest major landmark to the cruise terminals, making it the perfect first impression of Lisbon.",
    "history": "The site's history as Lisbon's ceremonial entrance dates back centuries. From 1511 to 1755, the royal Ribeira Palace stood here - the primary residence of Portuguese kings during the Age of Discovery. This location wasn't chosen by chance: it provided direct access to the Tagus River, allowing the royal family to monitor the comings and goings of Portugal's maritime empire. The palace witnessed the departure of explorers and the arrival of exotic treasures from Africa, Asia, and Brazil. On November 1, 1755, the great Lisbon earthquake struck on All Saints' Day. The palace was completely destroyed, first by the earthquake, then by the ensuing fires, and finally by a massive tsunami that swept across the square. King José I barely escaped with his life and was so traumatized he spent the rest of his reign living in tents. The king's powerful prime minister, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, better known as the Marquis of Pombal, seized this catastrophe as an opportunity to rebuild Lisbon along modern, rational lines. Rather than reconstructing the royal palace, Pombal created the grand Praça do Comércio - a statement of Enlightenment ideals and commercial prosperity. The square was designed by architects Eugénio dos Santos and Carlos Mardel and completed in 1775. The name 'Commerce Square' reflected Portugal's identity as a trading nation. The marble landing stairs became the city's official entrance, where state visits and important arrivals were staged. On February 1, 1908, King Carlos I and Crown Prince Luís Filipe were assassinated here in their open carriage, an event that shocked Europe and led to the fall of the Portuguese monarchy just two years later. In the 20th century, the square hosted major political events, including celebrations of the 1974 Carnation Revolution that ended dictatorship. Today it remains Lisbon's premier public gathering space.",
    "significance": "Praça do Comércio holds immense significance as Lisbon's most important ceremonial space and the historic gateway to the city from the sea. It represents Portugal's Age of Discovery maritime heritage and served as the symbolic entrance to one of history's greatest empires. The square is an architectural masterpiece of Enlightenment urban planning, showcasing the Pombaline style that rebuilt Lisbon after 1755. It witnessed pivotal moments in Portuguese history including royal arrivals, the 1908 royal assassination, and celebrations of democracy. For visitors, especially cruise passengers, it serves as the quintessential introduction to Lisbon - a magnificent yellow square where the city meets the Tagus River. The square appears in countless photos, paintings, and postcards as the iconic representation of Lisbon's grandeur and waterfront character."

The square hosts frequent events, concerts, and markets - check schedule. Cafes under the arcades are expensive but offer great people-watching. Martinho da Arcada (oldest cafe in Lisbon, 1782) is under the eastern arcade - historic but pricey. Go through the arch to reach Rua Augusta (main pedestrian shopping street). The marble stairs to river (Cais das Colunas) make iconic photos. Free WiFi available. Taxis readily available. Many restaurants under arcades - choose carefully as quality/price varies. Free public square so budget-friendly for photos and exploring."
