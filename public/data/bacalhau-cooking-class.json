    "short": "Learn to prepare bacalhau (Portuguese salt cod) in a hands-on cooking class led by expert chefs. Discover traditional recipes, techniques, and cultural stories while creating authentic Portuguese codfish dishes to enjoy with wine.",
    "full": "Bacalhau Cooking Classes offer an immersive dive into Portuguese culinary culture, focusing on the nation's most iconic ingredient - salt cod. Despite Portugal being a coastal nation, bacalhau (dried, salted cod) holds legendary status, with the saying 'there are 365 ways to prepare bacalhau - one for each day of the year.' These hands-on workshops, typically held in professional cooking schools or chef-led venues in central Lisbon, guide participants through the complete process of preparing traditional bacalhau dishes. Classes begin with the fascinating history of how bacalhau became Portugal's national dish despite the fish not being native to Portuguese waters - Portuguese fishermen traveled to North Atlantic cod grounds for centuries, preserving their catch with salt for the journey home. Expert chefs demonstrate proper desalination techniques (bacalhau must soak 24-48 hours before cooking), explain quality selection, and teach classic preparations like Bacalhau à Brás (shredded cod with eggs and matchstick potatoes), Bacalhau com Natas (cod with cream gratin), Pastéis de Bacalhau (cod fritters), or Bacalhau à Gomes de Sá (casserole with potatoes and onions). Participants work individually or in small groups, getting hands-on experience with ingredient preparation, cooking techniques, and Portuguese flavor combinations. Classes include complementary ingredients like Portuguese olive oil, onions, garlic, parsley, and potatoes. The experience concludes with sitting down to enjoy the dishes you've prepared, accompanied by Portuguese wine, bread, and often dessert. Chefs share cultural insights, family recipes, and cooking tips throughout. Classes accommodate all skill levels - from complete beginners to experienced home cooks wanting to learn authentic Portuguese techniques. Most sessions last 3-4 hours and include printed recipes to recreate dishes at home. Small group sizes (typically 8-12 participants) ensure personalized instruction. Some classes also visit local markets first to select ingredients and learn about Portuguese produce. This interactive experience provides cultural education, practical skills, delicious food, and memorable social interaction - all while mastering Portugal's most beloved culinary tradition.",
    "history": "Bacalhau became central to Portuguese cuisine in the 15th-16th centuries when Portuguese fishermen began fishing the Grand Banks off Newfoundland. Salt preservation allowed the fish to survive long journeys home. The Catholic Church's meatless Friday tradition made bacalhau essential. During Salazar's dictatorship (1932-1968), the government promoted bacalhau as national identity symbol. Today bacalhau remains Portugal's favorite fish, consumed at Christmas and special occasions despite being imported.",
    "significance": "Bacalhau transcends mere food - it represents Portuguese maritime heritage, Catholic traditions, and culinary ingenuity. Learning to cook bacalhau connects you to centuries of Portuguese culture. It's said that to truly understand Portugal, you must understand bacalhau. The dish embodies Portuguese resourcefulness, turning preserved cod into hundreds of delicious preparations."
