    "short": "One of Europe's largest indoor aquariums and one of the world's most spectacular, featuring over 8,000 marine animals and plants from 500 different species in stunning exhibits designed by Peter Chermayeff.",
    "full": "The Oceanário de Lisboa stands as one of the world's premier aquariums, built as the centerpiece of Expo '98 and designed by renowned architect Peter Chermayeff. The unique design places a massive 5-million-liter central tank at the heart of the building, surrounded by four habitat tanks representing the world's oceans - the North Atlantic, Antarctic, Temperate Pacific, and Tropical Indian Ocean. The central tank creates the illusion of a single massive ocean, separated only by invisible acrylic panels that allow sharks, rays, barracudas, and the famous ocean sunfish (one of the few in captivity worldwide) to appear to swim alongside smaller species. Over 8,000 marine animals representing 500 species call the Oceanarium home, including sea otters, penguins, rays, tropical fish, jellyfish, and corals. The facility also houses the world's largest nature aquarium, 'Forests Underwater' by Takashi Amano, a 160,000-liter freshwater exhibit. Educational programs focus on ocean conservation and marine biology. The Oceanarium was recognized as the first IUCN Center for Species Survival, emphasizing its role in marine conservation and research. With approximately 1 million visitors annually, it's Portugal's most visited cultural attraction.",
    "history": "The Oceanário was designed by architect Peter Chermayeff and built for Expo '98, the World Fair celebrating the oceans. It opened to the public in 1998 and became an instant success. In 2011, a striking new annex designed by Portuguese architect Pedro Campos Costa was added, housing temporary exhibitions and additional facilities. The Oceanarium has since become a global model for aquarium design and marine conservation education.",
    "significance": "Recognized as one of the world's best aquariums and Europe's largest indoor aquarium. In 2017, it was designated as the world's first Center for Species Survival by the IUCN Species Survival Commission, highlighting its crucial role in marine conservation and biodiversity research. The Oceanarium serves as both a major tourist attraction and an important educational and research institution."
