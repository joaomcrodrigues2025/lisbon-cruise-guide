    "short": "Arrábida Natural Park is a stunning protected coastal area south of Lisbon, featuring pristine turquoise-water beaches, dramatic limestone cliffs, Mediterranean forests, scenic hiking trails, historic convents, and renowned wine estates - all within a unique microclimate that feels more like the Mediterranean than Atlantic Portugal.",
    "full": "Parque Natural da Arrábida is one of Portugal's most beautiful and accessible natural parks, protecting 10,800 hectares of breathtaking coastal and mountain landscapes between Setúbal and Sesimbra. The park is dominated by the Serra da Arrábida mountain range, with peaks reaching 500 meters above sea level, covered in dense Mediterranean vegetation including rare cork oak forests, wild herbs (rosemary, thyme, lavender), and endemic plant species found nowhere else in Portugal. What makes Arrábida truly special is its unique microclimate - the mountains create a sheltered environment that's warmer and drier than surrounding areas, allowing Mediterranean flora and fauna to thrive. This produces an almost tropical feeling, with turquoise waters that rival the Caribbean. The park's coastline is dotted with some of Portugal's most stunning beaches: Portinho da Arrábida (a sheltered bay with crystal-clear shallow waters perfect for swimming and snorkeling), Galápos and Galapos beaches (secluded coves accessible by foot), Figueirinha Beach (long sandy stretch popular with families), and Ribeiro do Cavalo (a hidden gem reached by scenic coastal trail). The park offers numerous hiking trails ranging from easy coastal walks to challenging mountain treks. The most famous is the Serra do Risco trail leading to Portugal's highest sea cliff (380 meters) with vertigo-inducing views. The Trilho dos Pescadores (Fishermen's Trail) follows the dramatic coastline offering spectacular ocean vistas. Cultural highlights include the whitewashed Convento da Arrábida, a 16th-century Franciscan convent perched dramatically on the mountainside (visits by appointment), and the Forte de São Filipe, a star-shaped fortress overlooking Setúbal with a pousada hotel and restaurant. The region is also famous for Moscatel wine production, with historic estates like José Maria da Fonseca offering tours and tastings. Marine life is rich - dolphins are frequently spotted offshore, and the protected waters host diverse species making this a premier diving and snorkeling destination. The park provides habitat for wildcats, Egyptian mongooses, Bonelli's eagles, and peregrine falcons. From Lisbon, Arrábida feels like a different world - Mediterranean climate, turquoise seas, dramatic landscapes, and peaceful nature, yet it's less than an hour away.",
    "history": "The Serra da Arrábida has been inhabited since prehistoric times, with archaeological evidence of Paleolithic and Neolithic settlements. The Romans recognized the area's strategic and natural value. During the medieval period, the region was sparsely populated but valued for its natural resources. In 1542, the Franciscan friars established the Convento da Arrábida, seeking the solitude and natural beauty of the mountains for contemplation. The convent became an important religious center. For centuries, local communities lived from fishing, agriculture, and forestry. In the 20th century, growing environmental awareness led to the establishment of Parque Natural da Arrábida in 1976 to protect the unique ecosystems, landscapes, and biodiversity from urbanization and overdevelopment. Today, the park is managed by the Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests (ICNF) and is part of the Arrábida-Espichel Site of Community Importance in the Natura 2000 network.",
    "significance": "Arrábida Natural Park is recognized as one of Portugal's most important protected areas for biodiversity conservation. It's part of the Natura 2000 European ecological network. The park protects unique Mediterranean ecosystems, endemic plant species, and serves as critical habitat for endangered wildlife including Bonelli's eagles and Mediterranean monk seals (occasionally spotted). It's also a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve candidate."

Visit José Maria da Fonseca winery in Azeitão for Moscatel tasting. Combine beaches with short hikes for best experience. Mobile signal can be weak in remote areas. Respect nature - take all trash, stay on marked trails. Summer temperatures can exceed 35°C - bring shade and hydration. Swimming season: June-September, but waters are swimmable May-October.
