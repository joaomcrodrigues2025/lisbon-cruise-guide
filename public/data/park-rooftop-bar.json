    "short": "Perched on the 6th floor of a parking garage in Bairro Alto, PARK is Lisbon's most unique rooftop bar, offering stunning 360-degree panoramic views, lush garden atmosphere, and breathtaking sunsets over the Tagus River.",
    "full": "PARK Rooftop Bar is a trendy and urban oasis located on the unlikely 6th floor of a parking garage in Lisbon's vibrant Bairro Alto neighborhood. Not the easiest place to find - you have to walk into the parking garage and locate the elevator to the top floor - but the reward is absolutely worth it. As you emerge onto the rooftop, you'll discover one of Lisbon's best-kept secrets: a lush, green terrace where wooden furniture mingles with potted plants, creating an unexpectedly chilled-out atmosphere high above the city streets. The rooftop terrace has a very open and airy feel, with urban seating arrangements including both chairs and more casual bench-like pyramid structures. There's also a cozy lodge-like indoor area for cooler evenings. PARK offers a large selection of classic cocktails at reasonable prices, served from both indoor and outdoor bars, along with beers, wines, sangria, and bar bites like burgers. On Sundays, the bar serves an all-day brunch. The views are simply spectacular: 360-degree panoramas spanning from the Tagus River to the castle, with sunsets that are absolutely breathtaking. As evening falls, PARK transforms into a party destination with 'PARKBEAT' sessions featuring different DJs spinning tunes late into the night. The atmosphere strikes a perfect balance between daytime chill-out vibes and nighttime energy, making it ideal for sunset drinks before dinner or a full evening of music and dancing under the stars. This is an extremely popular spot that doesn't take reservations, so arrive early to secure the best seats, especially around sunset time.",
    "history": "PARK Rooftop Bar opened in 2013, transforming the top floor of a mundane parking garage into one of Lisbon's most sought-after rooftop destinations. The concept was revolutionary at the time: taking an industrial space and creating an urban garden paradise with unbeatable views. The bar quickly became a favorite among locals and tourists alike, pioneering the rooftop bar scene in Lisbon and inspiring similar venues across the city.",
    "significance": "PARK represents Lisbon's creative spirit and ability to transform unexpected spaces into unique experiences. It has become an iconic destination for experiencing Lisbon's famous sunsets and is consistently ranked among the best rooftop bars in Europe. The venue showcases the city's young, vibrant energy and has helped establish Bairro Alto as a nightlife destination."
