    "short": "Standing 52 meters tall on the Tagus River waterfront, this striking monument celebrates Portugal's Age of Discovery. Designed as a stylized caravel ship with 33 historical figures, it offers panoramic views from its rooftop terrace.",
    "full": "The Padrao dos Descobrimentos (Monument to the Discoveries) is one of Lisbon's most iconic modern monuments, standing majestically on the northern bank of the Tagus River in Belem. Designed as a stylized caravel ship ready to set sail, the monument reaches 52 meters into the sky and features Henry the Navigator at its prow, followed by 32 significant figures from Portugal's Age of Discovery arranged along two ascending ramps. The monument was first built in 1940 for the Portuguese World Exhibition, then reconstructed permanently in 1960 to mark the 500th anniversary of Henry the Navigator's death. Visitors can ascend to the rooftop viewpoint for breathtaking panoramic views of the Tagus estuary, the 25 de Abril Bridge, and the Belem waterfront. At ground level, a magnificent 50-meter compass rose mosaic, gifted by South Africa, displays a world map marking Portuguese maritime routes. The monument also houses exhibition halls and an auditorium showcasing Portugal's maritime heritage through multimedia presentations and temporary exhibitions.",
    "history": "The Monument to the Discoveries was originally created in 1940 as a temporary structure for the Portuguese World Exhibition, built from perishable materials including a light iron and cement frame with gypsum sculptures. After the exhibition, it was demolished in 1943. The monument was reconstructed permanently between 1958 and 1960, this time in concrete and rose-tinted Leiria stone with limestone sculptures from Sintra, to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the death of Prince Henry the Navigator. The project was based on Cottinelli Telmo's original design, though he had died and was replaced by Antonio Pardal Monteiro. The sculptures were modeled by Leopoldo de Almeida with assistance from sculptors Soares Branco and Antonio Santos. It was inaugurated on August 9, 1960, and in 1985, a cultural center was opened inside with a viewpoint, auditorium, and exhibition hall.",
    "significance": "The Monument to the Discoveries represents Portugal's golden age of maritime exploration and discovery, celebrating the courage and vision of Portuguese navigators who opened new sea routes to Africa, Asia, and the Americas during the 15th and 16th centuries. It stands as a symbol of Portugal's historical global influence and maritime heritage. The monument is one of Lisbon's most photographed landmarks and an essential stop for understanding Portuguese history and its role in shaping the modern world."
