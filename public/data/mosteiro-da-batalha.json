    "short": "The Monastery of Batalha is a UNESCO World Heritage masterpiece of Portuguese Gothic and Manueline architecture, built to commemorate Portugal's 1385 victory over Castile at the Battle of Aljubarrota. One of Portugal's Seven Wonders, it showcases the stunning Royal Cloister, Founder's Chapel, and the enigmatic Unfinished Chapels.",
    "full": "The Monastery of Batalha (officially the Monastery of Saint Mary of Victory) stands as one of Portugal's most magnificent architectural achievements and a symbol of national pride. Construction began in 1386 under King João I to fulfill a vow made before the decisive Battle of Aljubarrota (1385), where Portuguese forces defeated a much larger Castilian army, securing Portugal's independence. For over two centuries, successive Portuguese monarchs made the monastery their primary building project, employing the kingdom's finest architects and craftsmen. The result is an extraordinary fusion of Gothic and Manueline styles - Portugal's unique architectural contribution blending Gothic forms with maritime and natural motifs. The monastery complex includes the magnificent Church with its soaring nave and stunning stained glass windows, the Founder's Chapel containing the tomb of King João I and Queen Philippa of Lancaster (whose marriage cemented the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, the world's oldest active treaty), the breathtaking Royal Cloister with its delicate Manueline tracery and arches that seem to float like lace carved in stone, the Chapter House with its unsupported vault (an engineering marvel for its time), and the mysterious Unfinished Chapels - an octagonal rotunda that remains incomplete despite its haunting beauty. Master architects including Afonso Domingues (who allegedly continued working even after going blind), Huguet, and Mateus Fernandes created innovations that influenced Portuguese architecture for centuries. The monastery also holds deep national significance as the resting place of the Unknown Soldier, guarded perpetually by the mutilated 'Christ of the Trenches' from WWI. Intricate stone carvings depict biblical scenes, Portuguese royalty, flora and fauna, nautical instruments, and symbols of Portugal's Age of Discovery. The stained glass windows fill the interior with colored light, creating an almost ethereal atmosphere. Every corner reveals masterful craftsmanship - from the main portal's sculptural program featuring Christ in Majesty surrounded by apostles and biblical figures, to the smallest carved details in capitals and corbels.",
    "history": "King João I ordered construction in 1386 to commemorate the Battle of Aljubarrota and honor the Virgin Mary for Portugal's unlikely victory. The Dominican order was entrusted with the monastery. Master architect Afonso Domingues led initial construction (1388-1402), creating the church and Chapter House. Huguet succeeded him (1402-1438), adding the Royal Cloister and Founder's Chapel in elaborate Manueline style. Later architects including Fernão de Évora, Mateus Fernandes, and João de Castilho continued work through the reigns of multiple kings. King Manuel I (1495-1521) commissioned the Unfinished Chapels, but they were never completed, possibly due to Manuel shifting focus to the Jerónimos Monastery in Lisbon. The monastery remained with the Dominicans until religious orders were dissolved in Portugal in 1834. Major 19th and 20th-century restoration work, led by architects including Mouzinho de Albuquerque, preserved this national treasure. In 1921, the Chapter House became the final resting place of Portugal's Unknown Soldier. UNESCO designated Batalha a World Heritage Site in 1983.",
    "significance": "One of Portugal's most important national monuments and one of the Seven Wonders of Portugal. UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. Represents the zenith of Portuguese Gothic and Manueline architecture. Symbol of Portuguese independence and national identity. Houses the tombs of several Portuguese kings and the Unknown Soldier. Demonstrates Portugal's architectural innovation during its Golden Age."
